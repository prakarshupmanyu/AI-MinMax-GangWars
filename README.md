Implementation of min-max and alpha-beta algorithms for my Artificial Intelligence class

A creative and detailed problem statement is provided in Problem-statement.pdf. The python implementation is in file homework.py in the folder 'Python Answer'. The java implementation is in file 'homework.java' in folder 'Java Answer'. I also manually created some test cases to verify my code and test some corner cases. They are in the same directories with the names as MINMAX_case1.txt, MINMAX_case2.txt, etc. The files starting with MINMAX are meant to test MINMAX algorithm and those starting with ALPHABETA are meant to test ALPHABETA algorithm implementation. The expected output of a test case file is stored in another file (in the same directory) by the name of output_<name_of_test_case_file>. For example, expected output of MINMAX_case11.txt is stored in output_MINMAX_case11.txt.

Instead to running these cases individually, you can just run pu_test.sh file, which internally executes runScript.sh once for each type of algortihm (MINMAX and ALPHABETA). You might have to make small path related changes in order to run it.
